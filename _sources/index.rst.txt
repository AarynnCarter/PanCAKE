PanCAKE Documentation
=====================

Pandeia Coronagraphy Advanced Kit for Extractions (PanCAKE) is a Python-based simulation tool that extends the official JWST exposure time calculator (Pandeia) to produce more accurate predictions of JWST coronagraphic performance. 

Please note this an early release version of the code, so these webpages are still under construction.
